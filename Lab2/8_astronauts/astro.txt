The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) selected the first group of astronauts in 1959. From 500 candidates with the required jet aircraft flight experience and engineering training in addition to a height below 5 feet 11 inches, seven military men became the nation's first astronauts. The second and third groups chosen included civilians with extensive flying experience. By 1964, requirements had changed, and emphasis was placed on academic qualifications; in 1965, six scientist astronauts were selected from a group of 400 applicants who had a doctorate or equivalent experience in the natural sciences, medicine, or engineering. The group named in 1978 was the first of space shuttle flight crews and fourteen groups have been selected since then with a mix of pilots and mission specialists.

There are currently 50 active astronauts and 35 management astronauts in the program; 196 astronauts have retired or resigned and 49 are deceased (as of April 2013).
